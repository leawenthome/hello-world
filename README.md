# hello-world
first attempt at coding in Github. I am actually looking for a simple free coding space that students can use to share simple web pages coded in HTML and CSS. I work at a library, and teach kids coding classes to a range of ages. I thought Mozilla Thimble would be perfect, but it is super glitchy.
